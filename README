Image Processing Script

This script allows you to take JPEG images from multiple sources (e.g., different cameras) and
give them uniform names, including custom strings (e.g., names of people and places and
descriptions). You use it in two phases, the prepare phase (-p option) and the finalize phase (-f
option). Running improc.py -h presents full command line options.
