==========

This JPEG image processing script lets you take images from multiple sources and name them consistently and in chronological order. It requires the pyexiv2 module.

You use it in two phases, the prepare phase (-p option) and the finalize phase (-f option). Running improc.py -h presents full command line options. Together these let you assemblessemble JPEG images from multiple sources (e.g., different cameras) and name them chroonologically with custom strings (e.g., names of people and places and descriptions).

Running improc.py -h presents full command line options.
